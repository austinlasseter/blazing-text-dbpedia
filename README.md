# How to deploy a Sagemaker endpoint

## The final model is deployed in this [web app](http://blazing-text-dbpedia.s3-website.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/) on AWS

Check out my [Medium post](https://medium.com/@austinlasseter/deploy-an-nlp-classification-model-with-amazon-sagemaker-and-lambda-cd5ea6339781) explaining how I built this model.




All of the code in this repository is forked from two previous github repositories:
* [Architecting For Machine Learning using SageMaker](https://github.com/aws-samples/amazon-sagemaker-architecting-for-ml) by Emily Webber
* [Udacity Machine Learning Engineer](https://github.com/udacity/sagemaker-deployment) nanodegree program as shared on github by Cezanne Camacho

I also relied heavily on the videos by Emily Webber, explaining how to use Amazon SageMaker's BlazingText algorithm for NLP:
